\section*{Q.1}
I personally agree with the guidlines about academic honesty.  I find that even working with others, I need to crawl through the homework on my own to be able to grasp what I need to know, and be able to apply it later in my physics life.  If a solution to the homework is used, the knowledge just doesn't sink in as well.

I have read through all the side bar links and understand them.
