\section*{Proposal Summary}
(To be written after the paper)

\section*{Project Description}

\subsection*{Why is it important?}
Finding better ways to simulate simple homogeneous and inhomogeneous
fluids will allow us to study the fluids and predict how they may act
without spending vast resources on physical experimental setups. For
example, scientists have the capability of taking fluids down to very
cold temperatures, but it takes large amounts of energy to do so. If
we find a reliable simultaion that can be used instead, computers can
be tasked at running the simulations in many configurations. This will
save the energy required to physically test the configuration.

\subsection*{Why Soft Spheres?}
Currently hard sphere simulations are widely used (Verify) and can
give decently accurate results, but are still not as accurate as we
like. (melting point x2?-Verify and add) Hard sphere simulations are
limited in capabilities. Hard spheres have either 0 or infinite
potential interactions, they are either touching or not and are not
allowed to overlap. One way to attempt to improve the model is to
allow the spheres to overlap or soften their edges. By taking the
basis of the hard sphere model, and applying a potential interaction
to the spheres we hope to find a better more accurate model for
fluids.

\subsection*{Current Focus}
A Monte-Carlo program is being modified to simulate a soft sphere
theory. The data will be used to verify a density functional theory
for soft spheres. (Density functional theory-What is it? Add info)

\subsection*{Future Plans}
The Monte-Carlo simulation could be used to test fluid transitional
characteristics. By holding the temperature fixed and plotting
pressure as a function of the number of spheres used, the phase
transition of the simple fluid could be analyzed. The plot should show
a line of pressure of which the number of sphereâ€™s below it will be in
a loose flowing state, and the shperes that show pressure data above
will be in a more crystalline shape.
