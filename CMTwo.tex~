\section*{Question 1}
Assumption: v is a velocity, and will be negative if moving down.

(a): \[m\frac{dv}{dt}=-mg+c_1v\] If the ball moves up, $c_1v$ would be
positive and thus accelerate, which is not a drag force.  If the ball
moves down, $c_1v$ would be negative, and again, accelerate.  This
situation will not work for either case.

(b):\[m\frac{dv}{dt}=-mg-c_1v\] If the ball moves up, $-c_1v$ would be
negative, which would accelerate down and counter the motion of the
ball.  If the ball moves down, $-c_1v$ would be positive, and again,
counter the motion of the ball.  This situation will work for either case.

(c):\[m\frac{dv}{dt}=-mg+c_2v^2\] Whether the ball moves up or down,
$c_2v^2$ will be positive, and thus accelerate the ball if its moving
up or counter the motion if its moving down.  This situation will only
work if the ball is moving down.

(d):\[m\frac{dv}{dt}=-mg-c_2v^2\] Whether the ball moves up or down,
$-c_2v^2$ will be negative, and thus accelerate the ball if its moving
down or counter the motion if its moving up.  This situation will only
work if the ball is moving up.

\section*{Question 2}



\section*{Question 3}
\[\left|\frac{c_2v^2}{c_1v}\right|=\frac{0.22v\left|v\right|D^2}{(1.55\ast10^{-4})vD}=(1.4\ast10^3)\left|v\right|D\](a):
I
will assume that the quadratic term dominates over the linear term
when the ratio is 100 or higher.  Solving for v:
\[100=(1.4\ast10^3)\left|v\right|D\]
\[\left|v\right|=\frac{100}{(1.4\ast10^3)D}\approx7.14\frac{m}{s}\]
Speeds below 7.14 $\frac{m}{s}$ will be dominated by the linear drag
and speeds above will be dominated by the quadratic drag.\\
(b): The velocity of the ball \[m\frac{dv}{dt}=-mg+c_1vD+c_2v^2D^2\]
