# Here is where you may declare frames and corresponding tabs that will be
# created upon initializtion of Marina. Use the following syntax to include 
# frames and tab in the initilization process:
# Frame = tabs:tab_module_1;tab_module_2;etc..., name:Frame Name, size:width;height, bkg_color:red;green;blue
#
# The "Frame =" key at the beginning of the line tells the file parser that you
# would like to create a frame. Under "tabs:" list the modules that define tab
# functionality for the frame. If more than one module is listed they must be 
# seperated by a semicolon. The last module of the list should be followed by
# a comma. The "name:" key specifies the name of the frame to be created. This 
# name can be used to reference the frame and will be displayed at the top of 
# the frame window. The name should also be followed by a comma. The "size:" 
# key sets the initial size of the frame. It should be followed by two numbers 
# seperated by a semicolon representing the width and height in pixels, 
# followed by a comma. The last key "bkg_color:" denotes the background color
# of the frame. This should be followed by 3 numbers seperated by semicolons.
# Thes numbers represent the intensities of red, green and blue. These numbers 
# can range from 0 to 255.
