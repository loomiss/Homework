\section*{Experiment 1}
Measuring the resistance of a single resister at a single voltage setting will not allow us to tell if the resisor is ohmic or not.  More data is required.

The voltage must be varried and data for the current and voltage across the resistor collected to find out if it is an ohmic resistor.

A standard circuit (see circuit <name>) was set up.  The voltage was varried and data collected (see table <name>).

Data was also collected for the resistor at varying temperatures. (see table <name>)

A thermister was checked to compare to a regular resistor.  (see table <name>)

\section*{Experiment 2}
This experiment tests the resistivity of objects other than resistors. (see circuits <name>, <name> and <name>)

First a small diameter graphite rod was tested. (see table <name>)
Then a larger diameter graphite rod was tested. (see table <name>)

Data was then collected for two types of diodes. (see tables <name> and <name>)
(Data still needs to be collected for burning out the LED. Likely collect it on monday around noon, after capstones.)

\section*{Experiment 3}
A circuit to test potential dividers was set up. (see circuit <name>)

Resistor 2, the one the potential was checked across was varried from 200$\Omega$ to 1M$\Omega$.  (see table <name>)

The same types of measurements were done starting with 16k$\Omega$ of each resistor, then varying resistor 2 again. (see table <name>)

\section*{Experiment 4}

To gain the knowledge needed to find internal resistances ($R_{int}$)\ and internal voltage ($V_{int}$) ($V_{th}$) or Thevenin voltage) a complex circuit was created. (see circuit <name>)  Using this circuit, the voltage across the far terminal ($V_{th}$) simulates the voltage we see from a powersupply.  The power supply has an internal resistance, and using the methods learned in this experiment, they can be analyzed and found.

(Calculated values to be inserted here)

\section*{Experiment 5}

Using the Tevenin analysis from Experiment 4, the internal resistances of the DC power supply and the DMM measurement devices can be obtained.  (see table <name>)
(the internal resistance of the dmm still needs to be found, will take that data when the data is collected for the diode.)
